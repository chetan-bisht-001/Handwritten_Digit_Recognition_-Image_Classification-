Handwritten Digit Recognition (Classical ML)

This project implements a complete handwritten digit recognition system using classical machine learning models on the MNIST dataset (CSV format).

Key Highlights

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

Data normalization and PCA (95% variance) for dimensionality reduction

Model training using KNN, SVM (RBF), and Decision Tree

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Error analysis using confusion matrices and misclassified digit visualization

Performance improvement using AdaBoost and Voting Ensemble

Models Used

KNN – distance-based baseline model

SVM (RBF) – best individual performance

Decision Tree – fast and interpretable

Ensemble (Voting + Boosted DT) – most robust results

Results (Approx.)
Model	Accuracy
KNN	96–97%
SVM	97–98%
Decision Tree	85–88%
Ensemble	~98%
Tech Stack
